List of clean variables:

manhattan - object used to store CSV of manhattan data. Note first four obs deleted before loading

manhattan.sale - object used to store the homes with an actual sale price

manhattan$sale.price.n -intermediate object used to store data in cleaning process

manhattan$gross.sqft - gross sq. ft of residence

manhattan$land.sqft - sq. ft of property

manhattan$year.built - when the home was built

manhattan.homes - object used to store 'family' homes (building class category = FAMILY)

manahttan.homes.outliers - defines outliers as sale price (log10) <= 5 

manhattan.homes - object to exclude outliers


Code to obtain tidy data set:

#write function (T/F) to count 0's True = $0 sale price
manhattan$SALE.PRICE.N <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", manhattan$SALE.PRICE))
count(is.na(manhattan$SALE.PRICE.N))

#change headers to lower case
names(manhattan) <- tolower(names(manhattan))

## Get rid of leading digits
manhattan$gross.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", manhattan$gross.square.feet))
manhattan$land.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", manhattan$land.square.feet))

#change this from character to numeric
manhattan$year.built <- as.numeric(as.character(manhattan$year.built))
manhattan$year.built

## for now, let's look at 1-, 2-, and 3-family homes #grepl returns TRUE if string contains "FAMILY"
manhattan.homes <- manhattan.sale[which(grepl("FAMILY",manhattan.sale$building.class.category)),]

## remove outliers that seem like they weren't actual sales
manhattan.homes$outliers <- (log10(manhattan.homes$sale.price.n) <=5) + 0
manhattan.homes <- manhattan.homes[which(manhattan.homes$outliers==0),]
